# checkboxvaluemover
Project Description:-
Create a user-friendly web application using React that allows users to manage and move values between two boxes efficiently. The application consists of two containers, each containing a list of items with accompanying checkboxes for selection.

Project Requirement:-
1) Bidirectional Movement: Users can select one or multiple checkboxes from either the left or right container, indicating their intention to move these items.
2) Move Buttons: The application offers two buttons, "Left to Right" and "Right to Left." Clicking "Left to Right" moves the selected items from the left container to the right, and clicking "Right to Left" does the reverse.
3) Visual Feedback: The selected items should be visually highlighted to provide clear feedback to the user about their selection.
4) Efficiency: The goal is to create an efficient method for users to manage items in both containers, reducing the need for excessive clicking.
5) Clear Count: Include a visible count of the total number of items in both containers to keep track of the number of items in each box.
